# ECCC_Document_Management_System
A school project.
We were tasked to take on the role of a Project Manager, Software Tester, and Software Designer. A 60 page document including various design documents (e.g. gantt charts, activity diagrams, use cases), test cases (e.g. non-functional and functional), and overal thinking of the full scope of the project is included. 
The purpose of showing this on github is to promote the developer's ability to plan a large project, develop test cases, and create design documents.
